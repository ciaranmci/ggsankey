\description{
Creates a sankey plot which visualize flows between nodes. Each observation needs to have a `x` aesthetic as well as a `next_x` column which declares where that observation should flow.
Also each observation should have a `node` and a `next_node` aesthetic which provide information about which group in the y-direction. By default each row of the data frame is counted to calculate the size of flows. A manual flow value can be added with the `value` aesthetic.

\section{Aesthetics}{

geom_sankey_subset understand the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in
bold):

- **x0**
- **y0**
- **a**
- **b**
- **angle**
- m1
- m2
- color
- fill
- size
- linetype
- alpha
- lineend
